        <h3>our story</h3>
        <p>
          For us, sustainability is not a lofty idea but a fundamental, and
          necessary, endeavor. Our concept is about the food and drink of
          course, but it’s also about our team, our facilities, our practices,
          and the hundreds of decisions we make each day that affect the world
          around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe it’s about finding a balance, which allows us to sustain
          our quest of making quality, accessible food, while also giving back
          to our community and the environment.

              I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal in Foodie.
              I had a 3 course meal, with a couple of beers. Considering the
              quality, the price is reasonable. Ideal for those who want a
              romantic night out. There was also plenty of room for bigger
              groups.

              We are so fortunate to have this place just a few minutes drive
              away from home. Food is stunning, both the tapas and downstairs
              restaurant. Cocktails wow, wine great and lovely selection of
              beers. Love this place and will continue to visit.

              This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is
              also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what
              they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy
              is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian classics
              and some twists, and for their prices it’s 100% worth it.
